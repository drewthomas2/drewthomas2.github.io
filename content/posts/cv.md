## Work Experience

### Abbott Laboratories - Test Development Engineer

_Sylmar, CA_

Jul. 2024 - present

Worked individually and with a small team to develop software for testing mixed signal pacemaker ICs on wafer. Gained familiarity with ARM architecture, digital, analog, and mixed signal test techniques by developing automated test software for multiple ICs. Interfaced with diverse groups across R&D, firmware, systems, EE, IC, etc. to ensure our software was covering across system requirements. Performed data analysis on production yield data using python to analyze the effectiveness of our group’s software.

## Projects

### New Wafer Test Development

_Abbott Laboratories - Sylmar, CA_

Jul. 2025 - present

Worked on the development of a test application for a new microcontroller & pacemaker IC. This involved working closely with design and characterization teams, working through technical documentation, and understanding a brand new chip. I created a variety of mixed signal tests on sub circuits such as a temperature sensor, pace controller, sensing module, hall sensor, charge accumulator, etc. I also worked on the ARM SWD communication bus.

### Wafer Test Port

_Abbott Laboratories - Sylmar, CA_

Jul. 2024 - May. 2025

Worked to port the test software for an IC to a new test system. This project expanded the coverage of the IC’s functionality and reduced test time by 40%. We were also able to increase yield in large scale production. My work on this project involved leading development the tests for a charge pump sub circuit, performing test time reduction, contributing to code reviews, and testing the software on wafer. I gained lots of experience debugging software and hardware. I contributed heavily to the documentation for the projects, creating specifications and reports to ensure traceability. After the release of the project I helped perform data analysis on production test data.

### Senior Design Project

_Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo, CA_

Sept. 2023 - Jun. 2024

Along with a small team, created a Thermo-Electric Generator (TEG) module optimized to convert heat into electricity for people living in remote areas. The device is designed to be mounted to a wood burning stove and drive a 5V and 12V supply to charge a battery. A maximum power point tracking (MPPT) IC and several DC-DC switching regulators were used to convert the unregulated supply from the TEG into useable power. I assisted with board layout, circuit design, test design, and microcontroller coding. Our team completed a thesis paper on the project which is available on Cal Poly Digital Commons. 

### Biophilic Instrument Pavilion Project – Researcher

_Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo, CA_

Oct. 2023 - May 2024

Programmed microcontrollers to run computer vision algorithm informing digital synthesis. Collaborated as part of an interdisciplinary team of engineers and architects. Together we created an art installation which interacts with the natural environment to create an immersive audio and visual experience.

### Home Server

_Personal Project_

Sept. 2024 - present

Implemented a home server on my network to serve as a network storage device. I run services such as Immich and Pi-Hole to host my photos and block ads on the network.
