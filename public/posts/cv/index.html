Gained familiarity with ARM architecture, digital, analog, and mixed signal test techniques by developing automated test software for multiple ICs. Interfaced with diverse groups across R\u0026D, firmware, systems, EE, IC, etc. to ensure our software was covering across system requirements. Performed data analysis on production yield data using python to analyze the effectiveness of our group’s software.\nProjects New Wafer Test Development Abbott Laboratories - Sylmar, CA\nJul. 2025 - present\nWorked on the development of a test application for a new microcontroller \u0026 pacemaker IC. This involved working closely with design and characterization teams, working through technical documentation, and understanding a brand new chip. I created a variety of mixed signal tests on sub circuits such as a temperature sensor, pace controller, sensing module, hall sensor, charge accumulator, etc. I also worked on the ARM SWD communication bus.\nWafer Test Port Abbott Laboratories - Sylmar, CA\nJul. 2024 - May. 2025\nWorked to port the test software for an IC to a new test system. This project expanded the coverage of the IC’s functionality and reduced test time by 40%. We were also able to increase yield in large scale production. My work on this project involved leading development the tests for a charge pump sub circuit, performing test time reduction, contributing to code reviews, and testing the software on wafer. I gained lots of experience debugging software and hardware. I contributed heavily to the documentation for the projects, creating specifications and reports to ensure traceability. After the release of the project I helped perform data analysis on production test data.\nSenior Design Project Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo, CA\nSept. 2023 - Jun. 2024\nAlong with a small team, created a Thermo-Electric Generator (TEG) module optimized to convert heat into electricity for people living in remote areas. The device is designed to be mounted to a wood burning stove and drive a 5V and 12V supply to charge a battery. A maximum power point tracking (MPPT) IC and several DC-DC switching regulators were used to convert the unregulated supply from the TEG into useable power. I assisted with board layout, circuit design, test design, and microcontroller coding. Our team completed a thesis paper on the project which is available on Cal Poly Digital Commons. Biophilic Instrument Pavilion Project – Researcher Cal Poly - San Luis Obispo, CA\nOct. 2023 - May 2024\nProgrammed microcontrollers to run computer vision algorithm informing digital synthesis. Collaborated as part of an interdisciplinary team of engineers and architects. Together we created an art installation which interacts with the natural environment to create an immersive audio and visual experience.\nHome Server Personal Project\nSept. 2024 - present\nImplemented a home server on my network to serve as a network storage device. I run services such as Immich and Pi-Hole to host my photos and block ads on the network.\nSkills Circuit Analysis Experience analyzing and designing using circuits for a variety of applications. Particularly interested in signal processing, signal integrity, and high frequency electronics. Proficiency using lab equipment such as oscilloscopes, power supplies/source-meters, AWGs, VNAs, as well as SPICE simulation tools.\nCircuit Design Completed coursework designing digital logic circuits, amplifiers, and analog filters. Experience analyzing semiconductor performance and characteristics. Proficiency designing PCBs.\nProgramming C++/C, Python, Bash, MATLAB, RISC-V Assembly, and System Verilog. Knowledge of makefiles, rpm creation/installation, git, and other software development tools. Experience maintaining and developing on Linux/Unix systems. Experience working with microcontrollers including Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ARM Cortex.\nDigital Signal Processing Knowledge of broad range of DSP techniques including adaptive filtering and computer vision.\nSemiconductor Wafer Test Familiarity with Cohu DxV and TEL Precio Octo test station and prober. Societies \u0026 Awards Cal Poly Cycling Team – Sponsorship officer 2022-2023\nSept. 2020 - Jun. 2024 Cal Poly Audio Engineering Club\nSept. 2021 - Jun. 2024\nEagle Scout – BSA Troop 77\nOct. 2018\n",
